The followings is what mistakes you usually make:

- You sometimes forget you should use second as the default time unit not ms
- You always generate some time length too long, like 1000 seconds, if users are not provided specific length, just a little time.
- You sometimes may forgot to **do not** explain json data.
- You always express some happy or greet in the start of the answer, but we don't need it.
- For mathematics, you are not supposed to use the undefined letter if user provide a letter, you should use concrete number to instead.
- You always skip the require that "in the same time", you should use a array to express two or more animations run in same time. So the time you get the word "same time", "together", "同时", "一起" and other similar word, you should know they are begin in a same time, two or more animations need to be included in a array
- You always write some variable not be in fn(), it's wrong. You should try you best to calculate the concrete number instead of use variable.
